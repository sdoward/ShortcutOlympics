# ShortcutOlympics
A game which encourages Android teams to move to "mouseless driven development"

## The Concept

We can be more effective developers if we use shortcuts over the mouse

This stems from [this talk about mouseless driven development](https://vimeo.com/98922030).

## The Game

The game is based of [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2GC6P5hPeA). Which essentially
demonstrates how effective android development can be without a mouse.

**How to play**: A team of developers spends the week learning the shortcuts for that particular week. At the end of
the week the developers must each go through the tasks and complete them without using the mouse.

For each completed task 1 point is given. For each touch of the mouse a point is deducted. After
the agreed upon time frame the developer with the most points is crowned the "shortcut champion"

## Agenda

- **Week 1 (0:00 - 4:32)** - http://www.youtube.com/v/Y2GC6P5hPeA?start=0&end=272&version=3

## Caveats

- At the moment only 1 weeks worth of content is provided. Hopefully other devs can contribute to
extend the the content based off the video.
- Although this is designed as a team game it would work as a great tutorial for devs without a team
